# pytermgame

You've seen frameworks for making terminal apps (`textual`, `pytermgraphics`, `asciimatics`) ... but how about a framework for games ... like `pygame`?


Working example: `jet_and_ball.py`
Installation: `pip install pytermgame`

TODO:
- support for more keys
- simulated scrolling (extended axis)
- use integer IDs to reference sprites (for performance?)
- support color using ANSI (Char class?)
    - option to remain black and white (less memory)
- mouse support
- more examples
