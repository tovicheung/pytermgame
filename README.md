# pytermgame
Like pygame, but in the terminal

Working example: `jet_and_ball.py`

`pip install pytermgame`

note: key input is a bit laggy on linux

TODO:
- support for more keys
- simulated scrolling (extended axis)
- support color using ANSI (Char class?)
    - option to remain black and white (less memory)
- mouse support
- more examples
- special sprites (background, text)
- more options at Game()
